## Welcome! I'm Sreehana Mandava!

I am a Senior majoring in Informatics at UT Austin. I am passionate about building usable consumer facing products that make an impact. Through this course, I hope to understand how to leverage quantitative data to make product decisions, adding on to my existing qualitative research skills.

When I'm not working, I like to:

-   Watch sitcoms (Brooklyn nine-nine is the BEST!)

-   Read books

-   Explore ice cream shops around Austin
